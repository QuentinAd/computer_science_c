# Sorting Algorithms

This directory contains basic sorting algorithm implementations.

## Bubble Sort

`bubble_sort.c` demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm. It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The worst-case complexity is `O(n^2)`.

Compile and run with:

```bash
clang bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort && ./bubble_sort
```
