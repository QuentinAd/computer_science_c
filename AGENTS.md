# Instructions for Contributors

- Run `bash scripts/run_tests.sh` before committing to verify that all C sources compile and tests pass.
- Format any C/C++ source files you modify using `clang-format` with the LLVM style.
- Update the README if you add new examples or folders.
- Keep the repository history linear; avoid creating new branches when submitting changes.
