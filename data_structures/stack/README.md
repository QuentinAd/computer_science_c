# Stack

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

## Key Operations

- **Push**: Insert an element at the top.
- **Pop**: Remove the top element.
- **Peek**: View the top element without removing it.
- **is_empty**: Check if the stack has no elements.

Stacks are commonly used for expression evaluation, backtracking, and managing function calls.

See [stack.c](stack.c) for a basic array implementation.

## Compile and Run

```bash
clang stack.c -o stack && ./stack
```
