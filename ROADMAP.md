# Roadmap

This roadmap tracks upcoming phases for expanding the repository with memory operations and missing C/C++ topics.

## Phase 1: Repository scaffolding & roadmap updates
- [x] Update the top-level README to include Memory Operations and outline upcoming topics.
- [x] Add the `memory_operations/` directory with initial subtopics and example code.
- [x] Maintain this roadmap so contributors can track progress.

## Phase 2: Build the fundamentals of memory operations
- [x] Pointer arithmetic walkthroughs and exercises.
- [x] Dynamic memory management with heap allocations.
- [x] Memory layout demonstrations (stack, heap, globals, statics).
- [x] Custom `memcpy`/`memset` implementations with unit tests.
- [x] Exercises and problem sets per subtopic.

## Phase 3: Add memory-mapped I/O (MMIO)
- Simulated MMIO using `mmap` on regular files.
- Optional embedded example with strict safety warnings.
- Cross-platform notes for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Phase 4: Fill in missing C/C++ concepts
- [x] Structuring a codebase (headers, modules, build tools).
- [x] Structures & classes in C and C++.
- [x] Exception handling patterns in C and C++.

## Phase 5: Additional enhancements and polish
- Finish missing operator topics under `basic_operations/`.
- Expand sorting algorithms in `algorithms/sorting/`.
- Improve testing guidance and coverage with Unity.
- Add safety notes and interactive exercises.
